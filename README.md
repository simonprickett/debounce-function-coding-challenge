# Debounce Function Coding Challenge

This repo contains the solution that [Suze Shardlow](https://suze.dev) and I came up with for January 2020's coding challenge at San Diego JS Fundamental JS Meetup.  The challenge was:

> A debounce function accepts two arguments: a time delay and another 
> function to execute after no more of a given action has occurred for 
> the length of the delay.
> 
> They are often using in search inputs that will wait until you stop 
> typing for about 200-300 milliseconds before bringing up a list of 
> search suggestions.
>
> Without consulting Stackoverflow, Lodash, or Underscore, write a 
> debounce function.
> 
> Write your solution on Codepen.io, JsFiddle, or Codesandbox.io so you 
> can share it with other attendees.
